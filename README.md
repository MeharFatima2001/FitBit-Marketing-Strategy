# FitBit-Marketing-Strategy
This repository contains my Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics specialization, focused on the Bellabeat Leaf wellness tracker. The project follows the six-step data analysis roadmap (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act) to uncover insights from smart wearable usage and translate them into actionable marketing strategies.
| **KPI**                          | **Definition**                                     | **Insight from Data**                                    | **Business Implication**                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Average Daily Steps**          | Mean steps per user per day                        | \~7.6k steps/day → **24% below CDC 10k benchmark**       | Opportunity to **promote activity goals** via gamified challenges & streaks       |
| **Calories Burned**              | Daily calories expended                            | Strong positive correlation with steps                   | Reinforce **Leaf’s accuracy & usefulness** in tracking fitness                    |
| **Active Minutes**               | Minutes/day of moderate-to-high intensity activity | Majority under 30 mins/day                               | Market **habit-building features** (daily reminders, quick workouts)              |
| **Sleep Duration**               | Average hours slept per night                      | \~6.9 hrs/night → **below 7–9 hr guideline**             | Position Leaf as a **sleep wellness companion** (bedtime nudges, stress tracking) |
| **Sleep Efficiency**             | Ratio: time asleep ÷ time in bed                   | Lower for irregular sleepers; higher in consistent users | Highlight **stress reduction & mindfulness features** to improve sleep quality    |
| **Tracking Consistency**         | % of days with data logged                         | <35% logged daily; weekends under-tracked                | Need for **retention strategies** (notifications, streak rewards, habit loops)    |
| **Step-to-Calorie Ratio**        | Steps ÷ calories burned                            | Varies across users; reflects activity intensity         | Useful for **personalized coaching** and calorie-goal alignment                   |
| **Hourly Activity Distribution** | Activity by time of day                            | Peak 12–6 pm, lowest on weekends                         | Run **midday engagement campaigns** (e.g., “Afternoon Recharge” challenges)       |
| **Retention Proxy**              | % of users tracking daily vs. sporadically         | Only ⅓ tracked daily                                     | Target users with **habit reinforcement features**                                |
| **Projected Retention Impact**   | Expected lift from strategies                      | +15–20% retention improvement possible                   | Quantifies **marketing ROI** of proposed campaigns                                |
